In this work we show that it is possible for a passive observer of encrypted traffic, in this specific case visiting a website, to guess which content is being transfered based on packet loading patterns.

The scenario especially applies to ISP providers through which our internet traffic passes. They're theoretically able to guess what we are transmitting over the internet, even if we use technologies like HTTPS, VPN, or others.
