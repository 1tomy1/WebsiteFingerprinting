In the world of computers, encryption of data exchanged through the web is used to protect the sensitive information and provide its confidentiality. As the state of the art encryption algorithms are considered computationally infeasible to break and to recover plain text from cipher text, we try to circumvent the encryption and find another way to somehow "see" the encrypted content. By this we try to show, that encryptionby itself does not provide sufficient confidentiality of data.
